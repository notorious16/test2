# test2 
This is my first test project(Not entirely completed). It respresents itself as a site, something like a little blog. Here a visitor can 
create a record, which contains his name, e-mail, text, and a picture. The size of a picture is 320px in width and, if downloaded wider,
it compress itself to preset width(320px). The height changes proportionally. The format of the picture could be only JPG/GIF/PNG.
The records could create any visitor. Also there is the button for preview. It works without reload of the page. I hasn't used AJAX there,
but did It with another method. I guess it is not quite right, but I hope you will judge my inventiveness rather then correctness at that
precise moment. Then, there is also an entry form for administrator. There is a simple method of checking if it is an admin. If it is him, he will have some special capabilities(they will be done soon). Also in this application will be realized possibility to sort record by it's name, email and special status. Output of records will be done in pages, three records per page(pagination).
All the project is realized on clear PHP using MVC pattern without any frameworks. 	
Layout is realized on Bootstrap.
