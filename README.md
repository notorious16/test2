# test2 
This is my first test project(Not entirely completed). It respresents itself as a site, something like a little blog. Here a visitor can 
create a record, which contains his name, e-mail, text, and a picture. The size of a picture is 320px in width and, if downloaded wider,
it compress itself to preset width(320px). The height changes proportionally. The format of the picture could be only JPG/GIF/PNG.
The records could create any visitor. Also there is the button for preview. It works without reload of the page. I hasn't used AJAX there,
but did It with another method. I guess it is not quite right, but I hope you will judge my inventiveness rather then correctness at that
precise moment.
